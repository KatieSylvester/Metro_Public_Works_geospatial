Due to the existing guardrail being substandard and the untraversable roadside embankment being within the clear zone, the installation of guardrail is recommended along the north side of Old Harding Pike beginning at Highway 96.
There is a 5.5â€™ wide asphalt shoulder on the west side of Old Harding Pike and a 3â€™ wide asphalt shoulder on the east side of Old Harding Pike. The roadside embankments have a slope equal to or greater than 2:1. There is a culvert crossing approximately 60â€™ south of Hwy-96 and the headwalls are approximately 12â€™ from the travelway on both sides of Old Harding Pike. Additionally, there is existing guardrail located approximately 100â€™ south of Hwy-96 on the west side of Old Harding Pike. The guardrail has no blockouts or terminal systems and is 19â€ off the driving surface""",To Address a Service Request (SR# 1013137) to install new guardrail at the intersection of Hwy-96 and Old Harding Pike.
